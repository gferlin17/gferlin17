Hello, I’m Geovana 👋  

I’m an aspiring developer with a background in Public Relations and Branding, currently studying Systems Analysis and Development.  
I’m naturally curious, detail-oriented, and passionate about learning - especially when it comes to technology.

At the moment, I’m focusing on **JavaScript**, improving my programming foundations while navigating the classic dilemma: **backend or frontend?**  

Here you’ll find projects that reflect my learning process, experiments, and growth as a developer.

**Technologies:**  
- JavaScript, C#, HTML, CSS  
- .NET / ASP.NET  
- Git & GitHub

**Fun fact:** once I start learning something new, I usually fall into a deep (and very productive) curiosity rabbit hole.
